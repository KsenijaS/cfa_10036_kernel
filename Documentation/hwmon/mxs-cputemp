Description
-----------
This driver permits reading the internal die temperature sensor embedded inside
Freescale i.mx28 SoCs. This sensor is read through two channels of the on chip
Low-Resolution ADC. After calculation, the three-sigma error of the temperature
sensor should be within ± 1.5% in degrees Kelvin. Additionally, the temperature
sampling has a three-sigma sample-to-sample variation of 2 degrees Kelvin. If
desired, this error can be removed by oversampling and averaging the temperature
result.

The formula is:
	(Channel9 – Channel8) * Gain_correction/4

As recommended by the datasheet, Gain_correction is equal to 1.012.
