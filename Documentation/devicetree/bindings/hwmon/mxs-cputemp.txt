mxs cputemp hwmon sensors
-------------------------

See: Documentation/hwmon/mxs-cputemp

Required properties:
- compatible: should be "fsl,mxs-internal-temp"
- io-channels: should list the two adc channels needed to calculate the
	       temperature
- io-channel-names: should map the previously listed adc channels to the "min"
		    and "max" value

Example:
	temp {
		compatible = "fsl,mxs-internal-temp";
		io-channels = <&lradc 8>, <&lradc 9>;
		io-channel-names = "min", "max";
	};
